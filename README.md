Description:

This program implements a first-come-first, round-robin, and lottery CPU scheduler.
The scheduler implemention must be specified by the user.


Instructions: 

1. Open the makefile and modify the "TestFileX.c" to link the test file number, X, of your choice. Save.
2. At the terminal prompt, type "make" and this will compile your code attaching the appropriate TestFile
3. The "make" command will execute the instructions in the makefile and save the created program -- "project1"
4. Running project1, type at terminal prompt:
	a. "./project1 FCFS"  - for first-come-first-serve implementation
	b. "./project1 RR"  - for round-robin implementation
	c. "./project1 LOT"  - for lotery implementation
5. If you want to change the TestFile, go back to step 1. If you want to run project1 with a different
   scheduler implemention, start at step 4.
